CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0
-------------------------

None yet!

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in networkPlot() which gave an incorrect error message when gene
      set nodes were selected but no edges could be drawn. Now a correct error
      message is given.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added argument ncpus to runGSA(). Enables parts of this function to run in 
      parallel, thus decreasing runtime. Requires R package snowfall.

    o Added function runGSAhyper() to perform gene set analysis using Fisher's exact test,
      as an alternative to runGSA.

    o Added information about genes in each area of the Venn diagram in the output
      of diffExp().

    o Added volcano plot as optional output of diffExp() and added argument volcanoFC.

    o Added argument ncharLabel to networkPlot() and consensusHeatmap() to control the 
      length of the labels in the plots and add the option to not truncate them.

    o Added the yeast metabolic model iTO977 to be loaded with loadGSC(), for detecting 
      reporter metabolites using gene set analysis. (See vignette.)

    o Added support for running networkPlot() on objects returned by runGSAhyper().

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Minor updates to the vignette.

    o Updated diffExp() man page.

    o Updated the main legend of the plot from consensusScores() to make it clearer.

    o Updated error-messages in networkPlot().

    o Fixed typo in PC variance plot produced by runQC().

    o Restructered this NEWS file.

BUG FIXES

    o Updated diffExp() to handle changes in lmFit() and topTable() from limma.

    o Removed suppressWarnings(), as temporarily introduced in version 1.0.1, in 
      polarPlot() around the calls to radial.plot() since warnings are now fixed in 
      package plotrix.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.7
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Updated consensusScores() man page.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.6
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Updated loadMAdata() man page.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.5
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Updated diffExp() to only use vennDiagram() of the limma package for Venn 
      diagram plotting in order to correct a bug when plotting more than three 
      circles. Also updated the corresponding man page.

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Updated the SBML section in the loadGSC() man page.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.4
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in loadMAdata so that also compressed CEL-files (*.CEL.gz) can be 
      loaded correctly.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.3
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Updated references in vignette.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.2
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Updated CITATION information.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.1
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Updated CITATION information.

    o Fixed typos in DESCRIPTION and piano-package.Rd.

    o Updated the man file for loadGSC().

    o Added URL in DESCRIPTION.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in loadGSC() so that gmt-files are now loaded correctly.

    o Temporarily added suppressWarnings() in polarPlot() around the calls to 
      radial.plot() since warnings appeared for example("radial.plot") in
      plotrix v3.4-6.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Now part of Bioconductor.

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Removed the arguments 'venn', 'heatmap' and 'polarPlot' from diffExp and 
      replaced them with a new argument: 'plot'.

    o The consensusScores function now does not return its result invisibly.

    o The argument order in consensusScores has changed: 'plot' has been moved 
      from last place to after 'method'.

    o Added citation DOI to vignette.

    o Updated the man page for consensusScores, added correct output description.

    o Updated the Description field text in the DESCRIPTION file.

    o Removed contrastName as output from runGSA and geneSetSummary, including 
      man pages.

    o Changed the man page for consensusHeatmap clarifying that the cutoff 
      argument is consensus score (not rank)

    o Updated the man page for loadGSC, clarifying the input.

    o Reworked the vignette to fit Bioconductor, removed section on R 
      introduction.

    o Change name of folder for example data from exampleData to extdata, and 
      updated man pages and vignette.

    o Changed so that total number of gene-level statistics are printed during 
      run, instead of total number of unique genes.

    o Removed 'typical usages' section from man page of loadMAdata since this 
      is covered in the vignette.

    o Updated the examples for diffExp, networkPlot, consensusHeatmap and 
      consensusScores to show how to handle the returned object.

    o Added CITATION file.

    o Added NEWS file.

    o Added more links to similar packages in runGSA help page.

    o Updated the installation instructions in the Vignette to fit Bioconductor.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in geneSetSummary when no directions are available.

    o Fixed a bug in diffExp() regarding the result table, when gene names 
      (annotation) are not available

    o Fixed a bug in diffExp() so that the heatmap shows gene names if available, 
      otherwise the probeset IDs

    o Removed man page for internal functions.

    o Updated the loadMAdata function to use the justPlier function from package 
      plier, instead of a modified version.

    o Removed internal function justPlierSpec.
