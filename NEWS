CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0 (currently devel: 1.3.X)
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added argument plot to consensusHeatmap() so that drawing the heatmap can
      be suppressed but the corresponding numerical matrix can be saved.

    o Added argument cellnote to consensusHeatmap() so that the information inside
      each cell of the heatmap can be chosen to be either the consensus scores (as
      previously), the median p-values, the number of genes or empty.

    o Added a matrix nGenesMat to the output of consensusHeatmap() containing the
      same information as printed in the heatmap if argument cellnote="nGenes".

    o Added arguments columnnames, colorkey, colorgrad and cex to consensusHeatmap() 
      for better control of the column labels, toggling of the colorkey, color selection 
      and text size.

    o Introduced the new function GSAheatmap(), which is similar to consensusHeatmap()
      but for only a single gene set result (gsaRes object).

DOCUMENTATION

    o Updated consensusHeatmap() man page according to new changes in the function.

    o Added man page for GSAheatmap().

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.9
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug in consensusHetmap() so that the adjusted p-values are actually used
     if adjusted=TRUE.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.8
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in diffExp() that in rare cases failed to output the vennMembers.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.7
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Changed so that argument cutoff in consensusHeatmap() can be set to an arbitrarily
      high number (e.g. Inf) to easily include all gene sets.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.6
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in loadMAdata() that removed duplicate entries in the annotation in 
      an incorrect way.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.5
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in diffExp() that returned incorrect gene IDs for $pValues and 
      $foldChanges if and only if annotation was previously supplied to loadMAdata() 
      AND the probeset IDs in the normalized data ($dataNorm) were unsorted. The 
      $resTable is unnaffected.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.4
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in the volcano plot in diffExp() for coloring points black.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.3
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Improved error checking of supplied annotation in loadMAdata().

    o Improved error checking of chromosome mapping in polarPlot().

    o Fixed typo in loadMAdata man page.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.2
-------------------------

DOCUMENTATION

    o Updated installation instructions in the vignette.

    o Fixed typo in consensusHeatmap man page.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in networkPlot() which gave an incorrect error message when gene
      set nodes were selected but no edges could be drawn. Now a correct error
      message is given.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added argument ncpus to runGSA(). Enables parts of this function to run in 
      parallel, thus decreasing runtime. Requires R package snowfall.

    o Added function runGSAhyper() to perform gene set analysis using Fisher's exact test,
      as an alternative to runGSA.

    o Added information about genes in each area of the Venn diagram in the output
      of diffExp().

    o Added volcano plot as optional output of diffExp() and added argument volcanoFC.

    o Added argument ncharLabel to networkPlot() and consensusHeatmap() to control the 
      length of the labels in the plots and add the option to not truncate them.

    o Added the yeast metabolic model iTO977 to be loaded with loadGSC(), for detecting 
      reporter metabolites using gene set analysis. (See vignette.)

    o Added support for running networkPlot() on objects returned by runGSAhyper().

DOCUMENTATION

    o Minor updates to the vignette.

    o Updated diffExp() man page.

    o Restructered this NEWS file.

BUG FIXES

    o Updated diffExp() to handle changes in lmFit() and topTable() from limma.

    o Removed suppressWarnings(), as temporarily introduced in version 1.0.1, in 
      polarPlot() around the calls to radial.plot() since warnings are now fixed in 
      package plotrix.

    o Updated the main legend of the plot from consensusScores() to make it clearer.

    o Updated error-messages in networkPlot().

    o Fixed typo in PC variance plot produced by runQC().

      diagram plotting in order to correct a bug when plotting more than three 
      circles. Also updated the corresponding man page.

      plotrix v3.4-6.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Reworked the vignette to fit Bioconductor, removed section on R 
      introduction.

      otherwise the probeset IDs

    o Removed man page for internal functions.
